Some VueJS examples.

**app.js** - this is the beginning of a Home Page Editor with Ajax and VueJS (work in progress)
**search_scroll_vue.html.twig** - this file is a template file from a Symfony project to begin testing Ajax Search
**laravel_vuejs** - this folder contains some Laravel interaction with VueJS that I wrote during my employment at Enigma Digital, but we then replaced it with Livewire
